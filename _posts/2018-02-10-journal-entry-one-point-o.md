#### Journal Entry 1.0: Saturday, 11 February. Moore's Law. Sod's Law. Everything that is possible is happening all at once.

#### 02-10-2018 Night
I had my RA interview today. I bungled it up. The limits of human stupidity are infinite it seems- I am abundant evidence of this. I walked into the room with my phone on.

#### Murphy's Quantum Law.

- Anything that can, could have, or will go wrong, is going wrong, all at once. If there are two or more ways to do something, and one of those ways can result in a catastrophe or pregnancy, then someone will do it.

A few minutes into the interview lo and behold, my phone rang. It was mortifying.

*But it gets **even** worse.*


#### Sod's law

While Murphy's law says that anything that **can** go wrong, will go wrong (eventually), Sod's law requires that it **always** goes wrong with the worst possible outcome.

And it did.

I completely misinterpreted the interview question in the first activity and fashioned my own question in its stead. I have always been told by my friends and the people who aspire to know me most intimately that I should consider going into politics one day, and perhaps I will. The true mark of a good politician is the ability to answer any question, if only by refashioning the question into one they find more friendly and works to their advantage. My little mistake was to nobody's advantage. Still, I am happy with how my day went overall.

What a beautiful thing it is to be happy on my own. A friend cut me off yesterday, and in its own way, that was liberating. My mind is free to dwell on other things, and my heart is spared of the heartache and risk that defines trusting in another person. No more breaking the butterfly upon the wheel. I liked to think that the human heart's capacity to endure suffering was limitless. I am now more infatuated with a theory of a theory of suffering and elasticity.

Elasticity has limits. As does the amount of suffering the human heart can bear. Either that, or the amount of suffering we are willing to bear, because Viktor Frankl described a limitless human spirit in his book Man's Search for meaning and his psychological analysis of his experience as tyranny's subject in the holocaust camps of this last century. Ah the human spirit. Frankl said something in his book along the lines of

**Elastic limit**: the maximum stress or force per unit area within a solid material that can arise before the onset of permanent deformation.

I had really interesting conversations with Gracie today about religion and the nature of belief. I was fascinated by how my readings about Descartes' demon and the Dreaming problem wove into our conversation today. I am asking myself whether there are any absolute truths. I am inclined to think not; for in everything, there is as much fact of the truth as there is of the opposite.
