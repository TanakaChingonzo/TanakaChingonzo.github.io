# Most people think the world has changed.

## It hasn’t.
 
A friend once told me, 
“if it is a cliché, then it is probably true.”

Life is difficult. Life is hard. C’est la vie. Cliches.

And these, perhaps more than any other clichés, are the truest. These are the rules that govern our world. Clichés. They are realizations that people have made over and over again. Pay attention to them.  Our world is a difficult place- now perhaps more than ever. 
We have the greatest opportunities in the time that man has walked this earth, and the greatest challenges. Many would argue we are largely responsible for both. What a time to be alive.

A time in which mankind both authors and erases his own future. Startlingly quickly. One step forward, two steps back. We are moving forward, slowly, although it may not seem like it. The world is not screwed. We are here to fix it.

>For as long we keep striving, we are not screwed. We will never stop striving. Humanity is trying. It is what has set us apart from the start. Our will to dominate our surroundings, to dominate nature and bend it to our will. Since we first tamed fire. Then the forest, then the animals, and then slowly, we we tamed everything, until we were left with one wild force to tame: ourselves.

In the face of everything that has changed since the first man discovered fire, and the invention of the wheel, not a lot about mankind has truly changed. 

Except perhaps that “a lot more of us are unhealthy now -[Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/8dff8662-e7f2-99df-38e67664abff1d05/)

and it only take a handful of people to destroy the entire world now- [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2015/2/19/8069533/end-of-the-world)

Life is hard.Besides that, no, not a lot has changed in the ways that count.
We still fight over our different religions and our interpretations of them. We still work, perhaps harder than any other generation before us has worked and longer and we are less happier.

But we have not changed that much in the last century. We keep striving for more, and must keep striving, but perhaps now we should give thought to taming ourselves and our insatiable hunger for domination. It cannot be quenched, and our world is finite.
