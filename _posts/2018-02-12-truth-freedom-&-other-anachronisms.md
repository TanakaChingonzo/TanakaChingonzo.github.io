#### Journal Entry. Monday, 12 February. Truth, Honesty and Other Anachronisms

Can the meaning of a word change over time? In a conversation I had with David yesterday, we discussed this. I am persuaded that it can. Language flows like water, rising, dipping, and changing shape constantly.

How much can a person change in a year? What about in 4 years? The question here isn't if a person can change, but how much they can.

The truth has gone out of fashion.


This is still a work in progress. Check back in a few hours and this post will be done.
