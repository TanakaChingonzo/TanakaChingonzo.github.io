*The winter his father turned 70, filmmaker and photographer Forest Woodward found a poem his father had written in 1986, the year Woodward was born. It was called "[The Important places](https://www.artifactuprising.com/the-important-places)*

Child of Mine, come<br>
as you grow in youth<br>
you will learn<br>
the secret places<br>
the cave behind the waterfall<br>
the arms of the oak<br>
that hold you high<br>
the stars so near<br>
on a desert ledge<br>
...the important places.<br>
<br>
And, as with age, you choose<br>
your own way<br>
among the many faces<br>
of a busy world<br>
may you always remember<br>
the path that leads back.<br>
...back to the important places.<br>
Dad to Forest, 1986<br>
