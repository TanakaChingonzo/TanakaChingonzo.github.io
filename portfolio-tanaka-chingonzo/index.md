## Rezident Zimbabwe
Infrastructure Reporting for Municipalities
<br>
<br>
![Rezident](/assets/images/posts/Rezident.png)
[Rezident.co.zw](http://www.rezident.co.zw/) is a communication platform built to bridge the gap between citizens and their city councils. The platform allows both citizens to communicate directly with city council and city council to communicate with its citizens. Our team was formed at Startup Weekend Harare in May of 2014 and has been undergoing development and refinement since then. The concept was born out of problems we each face everyday.Health, transportation, water and sanitation. Rezident seeks to be a practical and feasible solution to those problems.

[PRISM Brain Mapping](http://prismafrica.com/) designed for organisations to achieve day to day objectives, whilst experiencing: improved performance levels,

Humans are healthiest, happiest and most successful when the are engaged in ‘suitable work. e.g. Where they can use and be rewarded for using their own natural, behavioural preferences in an environment which both supports and rewards those preferences. When an individual is using their naturally dominant mode (natural work preference) they are one hundred times more efficient in the ratio of energy consumption than when they are using their non-dominant modes.

We live in a fast-paced and interconnected world where breakthrough technologies, demographic shifts and political transformations have far-reaching societal and economic consequences. More than ever, leaders need to share insights and innovations on how to best navigate the future. The World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos-Klosters remains the foremost creative force for engaging the world’s top leaders in collaborative activities to shape the global, regional and industry agendas at the beginning of each year. For over four decades, the World Economic Forum’s mission – improving the state of the world – has driven the design and development of the Annual Meeting programme.

## Pamwe Infrastructure Foundation
Community-sourced Infrastructure Information
<br>
<br>
![Pamwe Foundation](/assets/images/posts/Pamwe.png)
[The Pamwe Foundation](https://github.com/tanakachingonzo/pamwe_foundation_project) is a platform that will enable members of a community to work together to solve problems that the city councils and government have failed to address effectively due to poor communication with citizens. “Pamwe” derives from the Shona word, “Pamwe-Chete”, meaning “community and togetherness”. Communities become powerful when they work together, as exemplified by farming endeavors, retail cooperatives, and community art.

Cities across Zimbabwe have poor infrastructure due to the growing populations, and this problem is worsened by a lack of governmental intervention in maintaining the existing infrastructure. While this problem causes road traffic accidents, poses health risks and crime, it has not arisen due to shortcomings in the government’s budget for infrastructure, but rather,a lack of awareness about where these problems are occurring on roads, water pipes, and traffic lights. The cost for city councils to carry out paper-based field surveys of the city to identify all areas in need of repair is too high to justify. Meanwhile, city councils use paper filing systems that thwart effective interdepartmental communication of information, and this makes decision-making slow and repair turnover very low.
