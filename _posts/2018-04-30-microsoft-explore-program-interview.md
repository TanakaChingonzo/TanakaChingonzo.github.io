Last fall, I had the privilege of spending three days with Microsoft interviewing as a candidate for their Explorer program. The Microsoft Explorer program is a 12-week paid summer internship where interns can explore software engineering at Microsoft in their freshman or sophomore years. Groups of two to three interns are assigned a team and an impactful summer project.

I was initially invited to a phone interview which was mostly behavioral questions. The interview went well and it took the form of a conversation more than a formal 20-questions type of interview. I really enjoyed this. A few days after this, I received an email from my recruiter saying I was moving on to the final round of interviews. I did not see this email because it was being automatically routed to my spam folder in my inbox. It was not until roughly two weeks before my interview that I found out I had been accepted to the next round of in-person interviews in Seatle. The interviewing process was a little vague because it wasn’t supposed to be 100% technical nor 100% behavioral. The intent of this article is to aid future Explorer candidates in better understanding what the on-site interviews are like and, most importantly, how to prepare for them.

Pre-Interviews
I had about two weeks before I had to fly to Redmond, WA for the on-site interviews. During this time, I practically read every article and post on Quora and Glassdoor pertaining to the Explorer internship. After a lot of Internet browsing, I ended up compiling a large document with technical, product design, and behavioral interview questions.

Recruiters mentioned that Microsoft asked questions that tried to decipher the thought process of the candidate. Some questions would be intentionally ambiguous – what was important was the approach, not the solution. These sorts of questions were difficult to prepare for because one couldn’t change their thought process overnight. Nevertheless, I tried my best to prep – each day, for about an hour, I went through interview questions in hopes that some would be asked in my on-site interviews.

Interview 1
My first interviewer was a software engineer on Azure. He began by going down my resume, asking me probing questions about my projects and previous summer internship. Because I had worked on creating an internal RESTful API at Sizzle, he asked me about the functionality surrounding HTTP methods like GET, POST, and PUT and the differences between POST and PUT.



Post-Interviews
Because each interview was 100% technical and I wasn’t given a single behavioral or product design question, I was upset with how the interviews went. Every single question I was asked was something I had never encountered in my preparation.

In retrospect, this was an important lesson to learn because interviewers will try to ask questions that is outside the scope of what a candidate has prepared for. It is a very useful skill to fully understand a problem, come up with various solutions, and optimize them when requirements change.

After the interviews, we were given a free Microsoft hoodie and $55 to explore Seattle! I had a couple of friends studying at the University of Washington, so I went to visit them. We enjoyed a meal at Little Thai on Microsoft’s expenses.

Ultimately, the experience was phenomenal. It was my first time being flown out to an on-site interview, staying at an extravagant hotel with all expenses paid, and speaking with candidates all over the nation.

Decision Day
It took exactly a week for a recruiter to get back to me with a decision. I was getting very nervous because other candidates had already heard back with their decisions by the time I received mine.

Fortunately, I received an offer! I was ecstatic and shouted a couple of times in my room before settling down. Based on my preferences and interview performance, I was placed on the Azure Stack team in the Cloud Enterprise and Management group. This was exactly where I wanted to work. I had worked with AWS at my previous internship, so I wanted to get experience with Azure.

Concluding Remarks
I hope this article shed some light on what the Microsoft interview process is like and what to expect. Generally speaking, interviewers ask questions that are tailored to each candidates’ experiences and resume. It should not have come as a surprise that I didn’t get standard string or array reversal questions. Don’t be discouraged if some of my questions seemed difficult – there’s a high chance yours might be different.

Here’s the takeaway – Microsoft doesn’t look for candidates that memorize and regurgitate knowledge, but rather those that show a strong potential to grow and learn. The best interview preparation you can do is tackling technical, behavioral, and product design questions you have never seen before. Catching someone off-guard offers a unique way into probing his or her thought process and analytical skills.
