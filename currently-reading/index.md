Because I could not stop for Death,<br> He kindly stopped for me;<br>
The carriage held but just ourselves<br>
 And Immortality<br>
**'Because I could not stop for Death',**<br>

-Emily Dickinson

Do not stand at my grave and weep<br>
<br>
Do not stand at my grave and weep:<br>
I am not there; I do not sleep.<br>
I am a thousand winds that blow,<br>
I am the diamond glints on snow,<br>
I am the sun on ripened grain,<br>
I am the gentle autumn rain.<br>
When you awaken in the morning’s hush<br>
I am the swift uplifting rush<br>
Of quiet birds in circling flight.<br>
I am the soft starshine at night.<br>
Do not stand at my grave and cry:<br>
I am not there; I did not die.<br>
<br>
by Mary Elizabeth Frye<br>

<br>
Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave<br>
Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;<br>
Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.<br>
I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.<br>
'Dirge Without Music',<br>
-Edna St. Vincent Millay
