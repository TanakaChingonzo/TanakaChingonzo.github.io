Wherever you are, seek beauty there.
Find it in yourself and in everyone else.
Take it into your heart, and keep it there.
and in the despair that touches you when you fail.
Seek beauty in your happiness,
and in your suffering too.
The suffering touches your skin: it cannot touch you.
Seek beauty in silence.
seek it in the constant noise.
In the falling of the rain, pause to smell it,
and when the soft snow turns to ice.
Pause and say to someone, I see you..
Seek beauty in smiling strangers' eyes.
Carry it in your own smile.
Seek it in silent tears shed in the dark.
Give it to someone else with a "hi."
Find it between the flowers' petals.
Between your ribs when they are beaten broken.
Find it in your weeping. May you also find healing.
Find it in your heartbeat,
find it in your healing ribs,
As your wounds turn to scars.
Find everything you seek,
As you seek your happiness, and as you find sadness
may you find it in the beauty of the stars, and may it make a home in your heart.
