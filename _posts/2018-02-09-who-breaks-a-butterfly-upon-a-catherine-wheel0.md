title: Who Breaks a Butterfly Upon a Wheel
excerpt: "And because the past is never dead; it is not even past. The Sense of an Ending, and the untimely death of Aaron Swartz. Here is suicide as a philosophical question: does suicide make sense as an answer to suffering?"

College. We come here to learn and to grow. My classes are immensely enjoyable, and my professors are passionate about their work. My favorite classes this semester have been Computer Science and Sociology. I am enjoying the Mathematics course I am taking too- I think that is because I am applying myself more to my work this semester than last.

I wish I had more time to read.

It seems counterintuitive to me that I am here to learn and I have so little time to read outside of my required readings for class. I think it is in this way that college is more than anything else, a lesson in life more than in Computer Science and academia. It is a lesson in making time out of nothing, and assigning different values and importance to everything and everyone. I have learnt this semester to assign the highest importance and value to myself. It is a non-linear scale, but if it were that simple, if anything were; I would be an 11 on a scale of 10.
