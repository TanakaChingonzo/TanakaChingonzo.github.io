- name: Pamwe Infrastructure Platform
  descr: "Community-sourced Infrastructure Information. It is a platform that will enable members of a community to work together to solve problems that the city councils and government have failed to address effectively due to poor communication with citizens. “Pamwe” derives from the Shona word, “Pamwe-Chete”, meaning “community and togetherness”. Communities become powerful when they work together, as exemplified by farming endeavors, retail cooperatives, and community art."
