It accounts for up to 44% of all mobile internet usage in the country. WhatsAppâ€™s parent, Facebook took up only 1%. Mobile internet accounts for 98% of all internet use in the Zimbabwe.

I like to call my parents and family to find out how they are, and to let them know how I miss them. It is interesting to see how my preference for "free" calls has the effect of "increasing cannibalization of traditional voice and messaging revenues" on my country's economy. Nothing is free. I am not particularly enamored with Econet, or NetOne- they especially teach us that nothing is free- but they employ between them, thousands of people.

Each Whatsapp call I make undercuts their revenue. Money that would have been added to our gross national revenue. The small ways I contribute to our economy. Or undermine it. Unknowingly.

But it is more complex than that is it not? We have our Zimbabwean economy, but we also have our regional economy now- the SADC. Beyond that, we also have the global economy. Globalization, technology has given us the gift of connectedness, and ubiquity. 

>Everything is connected.

What globalization HAS not done is level the playing field.

People are now more widely connected, but even access to this connectedness is grossly unequal across the world. 

Facebook's starting mission was, "to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together."

In 2017, that mission statement was updated to 

> " to Give people the power to build community

and bring the world closer together."

I want to think there is a more equitable way to do this. A way that gives revenue to both the countries concerned, and to the companies leading this connectedness effort. It is admittedly, a slippery slope.

Globalization has made the playing field more precariously slanted and it has made those connected, starkly aware of it. The wealthy are wealthier and the poorer are poorer still. It is my hope that my generation can reduce the inequality we are inheriting today, and that empathy may play a more prominent role in the way we do business.


May our legacy overturn the exploitation and corruption we inherited yesterday.
