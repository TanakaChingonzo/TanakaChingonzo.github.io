<h2 class="hover-underline-animation" id="books">Rules of Engagement for you dear readers</h2>

Unlike the Wild West of most of the Internet, I abide by a clear comment policy on my blog. If you're not respectful, I will take your comment down.

That, most important, statement out of the way, here’s more you should know whether you’re a regular commenter or new to this site.

If your comment does not immediately appear on the site after posting, it may have been flagged for review. There are a number of things which will get your comment flagged for review, I ask that you please keep that in mind before resubmitting the comment multiple times or contacting me about it.

Use of any of the curse words and/or slurs Disqus have on their blacklist will automatically flag a comment so it won’t appear on my site. Some very rare and difficult to explain times, these words are used as part of a good discussion, these comments will be approved when appropriate.

Using a Disqus account without a verified email address will automatically flag a comment.
Fluctuations in the space time continuum. Sometimes things just get auto-flagged and I don’t know why.
Comments can also be flagged for review by my readership (please do not abuse this option for other users you simply disagree with, it makes my moderation jobs a lot harder).
Here are some things which will get your comment deleted.

Personal attacks against another commenter or the writer of the post/website. This can run from name calling to sentences which include the words “people like you” or statements which begin “I bet you” or “you must/probably” etc. This is regardless of what “side” you’re on.
Jokes or aggressive negative comments on the aesthetic appearance of a person (commenters, writers, and folks mentioned in an article alike).
Hate speech or other clearly intentional jerk behavior. This includes, but is not limited to: the use of the word feminazi or a comments which denigrates women, feminism or feminists, the LGBTQ community; broad imprecations or assumptions based on race; and anything that amounts to “ugh the gays,” “ugh liberals,” “ugh, fangirls,” etc.
Here are some things which will get your account banned.

Engaging in any of the previously mentioned delete-worthy behaviors consistently and as part of a clear pattern OR presenting a particularly egregious example of one of those behaviors as a first comment (New to the site? Stopped by just to say something horrible? We don’t need you here.) We normally give one warning to a user before banning unless a pattern of behavior is clear. However, if a user commits one of these behaviors as their very first comment, we’ll skip that step. Disqus grants us the ability to see a commenter’s patterns of behavior on other Disqus-enabled sites as well, and we do not hesitate to consider behavior on other sites when determining whether to ban.
Hate reading. If your history of commenting on websites makes it seem like you only visit the site to start fights or specifically to disagree with me whenever I publish a post involving my core themes and for no other reason, I will ban you. Conversely, if you feel the site has changed in a drastic way and no longer appreciate or respect our content but stick around to tell ,E that every day, I’ll also take that as hate reading. Feel free to keep hate reading, but you’ll not be able to hate comment any more.
It is at my discretion to ban anyone whom I determine to be a detriment to the atmosphere of the comments section, the site in general, and our regular readers.
