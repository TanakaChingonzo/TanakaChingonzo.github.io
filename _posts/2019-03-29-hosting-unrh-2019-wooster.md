A few weeks ago, we held the UNRH conference at Wooster. A month ago to be exact. It was the most rewarding thing I have ever done- I cannot remember ever putting so much of myself into something, or gaining so much from a work project. The reason for that must be because UNRH, more accurately the Digital Humanities are my work, and my passion.

Scott and I put in a tonne of work into meeting with the bureaucratic structures we had to negotiate, and Taylor, Arianna and the rest of the team put in an unbelievable amount of work for our group to be able to meet in Wooster and share our passion for the humanities. I cannot describe my gratitude to them now. If you have ever attended a conference and taken for granted the fact that everything seems to go smoothly, you need to organize one to appreciate the work that goes into it.

The depth and breadth of variety and quality of work that delegates talked about at the conference was incredible. Someone was studying and visualizing the evolution of meanings of words over time using data pulled from Twitter, someone else was working on mapping the history of an old military airfield, and how its history shaped the development of the town around it.


These were really interesting questions. Here's a list and description of some of them, and the talented students working on them.

Here they are: I do them an injustice by trying to summarize what they are here.
