This research project I am working on has me thinking. This man. Zhabotinsky, this man I will never meet, and yet, my job for a year, and for 3 years more, has been to work on this scientific empirical love letter to him. How he touched my professor's life. Death is such a waste. I will never meet him and neither will you. How many of us die this way? We all do. To conquer death will be our biggest undertaking as a species. Which one of us would not give anything to see someone we loved taken from us, again.
